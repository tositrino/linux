Hi,

This set of patches is inteded to prepare the HDMI driver to implement the DSS
device driver interface for audio proposed here:
http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-omap/msg67303.html

In preparation for that, it removes the current ASoC HDMI codec driver and
decouples HDMI audio build configuration from ASoC. Instead, a config option
may be selected by the parties interested in the HDMI audio functionality. The
last patch effectively implements the DSS audio interface.

Also, this set prepares the HDMI driver for the introduction of the OMAP5 HDMI
audio functionality by further abstracting the portions of code that are
generic to all HDMI implementations (e.g, N/CTS params calculation). Also, an
IP-dependent audio configuration function is introduced as an HDMI IP operation;
this function takes IP-independent parameters and is intended to be implemented
for each individual IP.

For the specific case of OMAP4, the configuration of the IEC-60958 channel
status word is expanded to provide more flexibility. Also, some duplicated
IEC-60958 definitions are removed to, instead, reuse the definitions provided
in asound.h The CEA-861 definitions are not yet added to asound.h. I will
send a patch for that to alsa-devel.

The changes for OMAP4 configuration expand the current support to cover more
audio sample rates: 32, 44.1, 48, 88.2, 176.4 and 192 kHz. Audio sample world
length of 16 through 24 bits as well as up to 8 audio channels.

These changes are based on the 3.3 Linux kernel plus the patches for the
audio MCLK selection (http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-omap/msg64302.html).

Validation was performed using Onkyo TX-SR508 and Yamaha RX-V367 AV receivers.

BR,

Ricardo
