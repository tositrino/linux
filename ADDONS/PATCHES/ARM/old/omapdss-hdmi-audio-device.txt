Hi,

This patch is proposed as a result of a previous discussion related to
include audio support in the DSS device driver
(http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-omap/msg64748.html)

As discussed in the description of the patch, this is intended to cover
audio implementation based on CEA-861 and IEC-60958, such as HDMI and
DisplayPort.

This patch #includes definitions from asound.h that are not yet present,
I will be sending the patch shortly to alsa-devel.

BR,

Ricardo
