# - completed, * - Not completed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
BUGS:
^^^^^
#1.  I2C arbitation lost is happening when bulk amount of registers are being dumped into the sensor.
*1-1 Fixed by adding 100 micro second delay between each write in the i2c code.

Implementation : 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#1. Driver cleanup functions in the module exit code are currently not implemented.
*2. Available IOCTLS enumerate in the driver currently not implemented.
#3. IOCTL - CTRL not implemented
#4. CAPTURE routine using (QBUF - DQBUF) not implemented
#4-1. Need to test capture routine

#5. Getting memory from __get_free pages producing Low memory warinig from the kernel 
#	Need to implement e-con specific memory implementation 

#6. Memory hard coded in inc_header.h which is used in phy_mem.c (This should be double checked by performing 
#	parse the kernel boot args and get the memory free information and feed into driver).
*6-1. Need to test work done on point 6.
	
#7. G_CTRL - ioctl should expose the ctrl limit to the user
#	VIDIOC_QUERYCTRL
#	example :
#		Brightness means
#		min		- -2
#		max		- +2
#		step size	- +1

*8. poll function need to implement
*8-1. select function need to implement
#8-2. mmap function need to implement

*9. Proper return value represents the error state must be sent from the driver.

#10. Current driver will send colour format as YUYV. Need to make it as UYVY

#11. Validation is needed in performing the supported colour formats available in the sensor.

#12 Negotiate with the available dimention with the sensor and tell the format dimension supported by camera to user. S_FMT /G_FMT

*13 Implementation of
	crop			-	VIDIOC_CROPCAP,VIDIOC_G_CROP, VIDIOC_S_CROP
	VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT		-	VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT,VIDIOC_ENUM_FRAMESIZES,VIDIOC_ENUM_FRAMEINTERVALS

*14 Need to handle signal CTRL+C in the driver and break the capture accordingly.

*15 Image Dimensions should be rounding off to nearest supported size of byte aglinment of (4) 

*16 From sensor uxga frame corruoption is happening, So we fixed in the driver to exclude the problemmatic dimension.

NOTE:
Minimum ioctls needed to procced by mplayer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Needed ioctl is 23		- VIDIOC_G_STD
Needed ioctl is 21		- VIDIOC_G_PARM
Needed ioctl is 25		- VIDIOC_ENUMSTD
#Needed ioctl is 26		- VIDIOC_ENUMINPUT
#Needed ioctl is 38		- VIDIOC_G_INPUT
#Needed ioctl is 2		- VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT

IMPLEMENTATION
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*1. Current driver is implemented in old style of v4l2 driver.
